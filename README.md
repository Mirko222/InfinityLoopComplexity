# InfinityLoopComplexity
http://infinityloopcomplexity.altervista.org/ <br><br>
Infinity Loop is a puzzle game. An instance of the game consists of a rectangular grid containing pieces. Each piece has a certain number of extremities. There are two game modes, in the classic mode the pieces must be rotated in a way such that each extremity of each piece is connected to the extremity of another piece. In the dark mode, the pieces must be rotated in a way such that each extremity is disconnected from all other extremities.<br><br>
Given an instance of Infinity Loop, we show that it is NP-Complete to establish if there exists a solution (in both game modes). We show two reductions (one for each mode) from positive planar 1-in-3 SAT, this tool implements such reductions.
